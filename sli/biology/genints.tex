\begin{block}{\textbf{Genetic interactions}}
occur between two genes when the phenotypic consequence of perturbing both genes is different than expected given the phenotypes of each single gene perturbation. BioPAX represents this as a pair of genes that participate in a {\it genetic interaction} measured using an observed {\it phenotype}. Genetic interactions use BioPAX classes: Gene, GeneticInteraction.

BioPAX currently negelects higher-order interactions due to a lack of data
