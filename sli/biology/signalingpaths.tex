\begin{block}{\textbf{Signaling pathways}}
involve molecules and complexes participating in biochemical reactions, binding, transportation and catalysis events. These pathways may also include descriptions of molecular states (such as cellular location, covalent and noncovalent modifications, as well as fragments of sequence cleaved from a precursor) and generic molecules. Signaling pathways use BioPAX classes: PhysicalEntity, Conversion, Control, Catalysis, Modulation, MolecularInteraction, Pathway.
