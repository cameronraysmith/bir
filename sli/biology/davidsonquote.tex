{\it One [...] idea, which underlies everything in this book, is the concept
of genomically encoded information processing. [...],
this is like the geological basis of the landscape. In my view, cis-regulatory information processing, and information processing at the gene regulatory network circuit level, are the real secret of animal development. Probably the appearance of genomic regulatory systems capable of information processing is what made animal evolution possible.} -Eric H. Davidson \cite{Davidson2006a}
