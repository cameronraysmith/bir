From bottom to top and on the left we imagine an information non-preserving interaction resulting from the inability of $a$ to distinguish in subsequent or {\it downstream} interactions the interaction of $d$  with $c$ from that of $e$ with $c$, whereas on the right we imagine an information preserving interaction wherein $b$ is capable of distinguishing in downstream interactions the interaction of $d$  with $c$ from that of $e$ with $c$.
