\begin{block}{\textbf{Gene regulatory networks}}
involve transcription and translation
events and their control. Transcription, translation and other template-directed reactions involving DNA or RNA are captured in a {\it template reaction} in BioPAX, which maps a template to its encoded products (e.g., DNA to mRNA). Multiple sequence regions on a single strand of the template, such as promoters, terminators, open reading frames, operons and various reaction machinery binding sites, are active in a template reaction.

Transcription factors (generally proteins and complexes), microRNAs and other molecules, participate in a {\it template reaction regulation} event. Gene regulatory networks use BioPAX classes: PhysicalEntity, TemplateReaction, TemplateReactionRegulation.
