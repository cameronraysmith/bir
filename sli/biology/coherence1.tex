We can make use of \textbf{existing theory} to characterize \textbf{coherence constraints} that must ostensibly be satisfied in any evolutionary process in which more than one level of organization become coupled such that one serves as a \textbf{base} supporting interactions among \textbf{higher-level entities} in another.

What may in one context be considered as \textbf{distinct levels}, may come to be viewed as part of a \textbf{unified system}.

This process of \textbf{unification} of distinct levels into a single system incorporating both may serve as a basis for induction in the consideration of arbitrarily complex compositions giving way to \textbf{multilevel} biological systems.
