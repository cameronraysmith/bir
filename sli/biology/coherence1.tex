We can make use of existing theory to characterize \textbf{coherence constraints} that must ostensibly be satisfied in any evolutionary process in which at least two levels of organization become coupled such that one serves as a base supporting interactions among higher-level entities in another.

What may be considered as two distinct levels, may come to be viewed as part of a unified system.
\end{block}

This process of \textbf{unification} of distinct levels into a single system incorporating both may serve as a basis for induction in the consideration of arbitrarily complex compositions of multilevel biological systems.
