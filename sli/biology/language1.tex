The language we use to express these constraints is sufficiently general that it applies equally to several different concrete formalisms for representing biological systems

For example, \textbf{algebraic structures} that have become commonplace in the context of network science: algebraic graphs, hypergraphs, or (cell) complexes.

The derived relationship between levels of organization in models of biological systems can be used to constrain dynamical models defined in terms of transformations of graphs or another concrete relational structure that seek to account for hierarchical transitions in evolutionary processes.
