\begin{block}{\textbf{metabolic pathways}}
described using the {\it enzyme, substrate,
product} abstraction where substrates and products of a biochemical reaction are often small molecules. An enzyme, often a protein, catalyzes the reaction, and inhibitors and activators can modulate the catalysis event. Metabolic pathways use BioPAX classes: PhysicalEntity, Conversion, Catalysis, Modulation, Pathway.
