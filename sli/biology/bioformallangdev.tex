The development of a formal language for modeling and reasoning about biological systems was suggested by Joseph Woodger in collaboration with the developmental biologist Conrad Waddington and the logician Alfred Tarski as early as 1937 \cite{Woodger1937,Woodger1951,Woodger1952,Woodger1952a}.

At that time it was perhaps difficult to understand how such a language could be put to use.

Today we have tools that could enable the use of such a language:

\begin{enumerate}
\item computational machines to automate the details of routine transformations within the language 
\item accessible, growing repositories of biological data.
\end{enumerate}
