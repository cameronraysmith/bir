The asymmetry of the adjunction can be dispensed with if the unit and counit natural transformations are in fact natural isomorphisms $\eta: 1_{\cC^{opp}} \cong GF$ and $\epsilon: FG \cong 1_{\mcD}$. In any limit in which this is the case the adjunction $F \dashv G$ gives an equivalence of categories $\cC^{opp} = \mcD$ and the information encoding-decoding process becomes bidirectionally exact.
