\begin{block}{}
A framework for the construction of a mechanism of local-global translation of biological information. $\mathcal{L}_0$ and $\mathcal{L}_1$ are respectively the categories of relatively local and global biological information structures. The Yoneda embedding functor $PSh$ constructs the presheaf functor category on $\mathcal{L}_0$. The functors $A$, $R$, and $L$ are initially defined abstractly and subsequently constructed.
