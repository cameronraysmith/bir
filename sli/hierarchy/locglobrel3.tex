\begin{enumerate}
\item We abstractly define a functor to be constructed $A:\mathcal{L}_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_1$ that assigns representations of global information and morphisms that preserve the structure between them to those of local information with respect to a biological system.  

\item Similarly, the functor $R: \mathcal{L}_1 \rightarrow \textit{Sets}^{\mathcal{L}_0^{opp}}$ assigns presheaves on $\mathcal{L}_0$ to the composite information structures in $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $L$ acts conversely. 

\item The categories of local and global information representation and the functors enabling partial translation between them is summarized in the following figure.
