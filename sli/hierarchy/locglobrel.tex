How can we describe the generic relationship between one collection of {\it local entities} and another collection of {\it global entities} that are composite constructions upon some method of combining or integrating local entities?
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Consider a category for each of the local and global levels of interaction, $\mathcal{L}_0$ and $\mathcal{L}_1$, respectively. 
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
In general, all the structure in $\mathcal{L}_0$ may be recapitulated in $\mathcal{L}_1$ but not necessarily conversely.
