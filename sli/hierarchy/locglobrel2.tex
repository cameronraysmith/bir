The relationship between local and global biological information representation is expressed in terms of a relationship between the categories $\mathcal{L}_0$ and $\mathcal{L}_1$.

We can construct a method for relating local and global biological information contained in these two categories.

The Yoneda embedding of a category into its associated category of presheaves by the functor $PSh$ and the associated result (lemma) guarantees that any category is a full subcategory of its category of presheaves for an arbitrary category, which we specialize to the case of $\mathcal{L}_0$ as $PSh: \mathcal{L}_0 \rightarrow \textit{Sets}^{\mathcal{L}_0^{opp}}$.
