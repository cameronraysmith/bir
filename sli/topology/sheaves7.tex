We are now able to explain how covering sieves on $\mathcal{L}_0$ defined in terms of epimorphic families of morphisms in $\mathcal{L}_1$ provides a Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which induces a site and sheaves on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which can be shown to precisely encode the category $\mathcal{L}_1$.
