We can further define an {\it almagamation} of a matching family as a single element $x \in P(c)$ such that
$$
\forall f \in S, \,\,\, x \cdot f = x_f,
$$
implying that $P(f)(x)=x_f$ and thus $P(g)(P(f)(x))=x_{fg}$. $P$ is then a {\it sheaf} for $J$ when every matching family for all covers of all objects in $\Ob(\cC)$ have a unique amalgamation.
