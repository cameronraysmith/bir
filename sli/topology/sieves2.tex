\begin{enumerate}
\item A (maximal) sieve is thus a collection of (all) morphisms impinging on a given object upon which it is defined. 
%Examples of sieves on an algebraic lattice are shown in figure \ref{fig:sieve}. 
\item There is a simple connection between sieves and the Yoneda embedding $PSh:\cC \rightarrow \textit{Sets}^{\cC^{opp}}$. A sieve on $c$ is a subfunctor $Sc \subseteq hom(-,c)$ of the functor in the presheaf category on $\cC$ that is represented by $c \in \Ob(\cC)$. 
\item Placing constraints on such sieves enables the definition of an abstract notion of topology on a category.
