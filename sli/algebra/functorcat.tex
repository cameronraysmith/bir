\begin{block}{functor category}
We can define a category having functors as objects and natural transformations as morphisms, which is called a functor category, by recognizing that every functor $F$ comes with the {\it identity} transformation $\text{id}_F : F \to F$. In addition, given a morphism of
functors $t : F \to G$ and a morphism of functors $s : E \to F$
then the {\it composition} $t \circ s$ is defined by the rule
$$
(t \circ s)_x = t_x \circ s_x : E(x) \to G(x)
$$
for $x \in \Ob(\mathcal{A})$.
This is a morphism of functors
from $E$ to $G$.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Thus, given categories
$\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ we obtain the category of functors between $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{B}$.
