\frametitle{A quasi-hierarchy of algebraic theories}
\begin{block}{}
Theory :: domain of discourse
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Elementary Algebra :: equational reasoning in a particular algebra
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Abstract Algebra :: particular classes of algebras such as groups, rings, or fields
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Universal algebra :: classes of classes of algebras
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Category theory :: given a list of operations and axioms in universal algebra the corresponding algebras and homomorphisms between them can represent objects and morphisms in a category
