Limits $(\lim_I M, (p_i)_{i\in \Ob(\mathcal{I})})$ are unique up to unique isomorphism, if they exist at all, according to the uniqueness requirement in the definition. Products of pairs and equalizers are examples of limits. The limit over the empty diagram is a final object of $\cC$. In the category of sets all limits exist. The dual notion is that of colimits.
