Colimits $(\colim_I M, (s_i)_{i\in \Ob(\mathcal{I})})$ are unique up to unique isomorphism by the uniqueness requirement in the definition. Coproducts of pairs and coequalizers are examples of colimits. The colimit over an empty diagram is an initial object of $\mathcal{C}$. All colimits exist in the category of sets.
