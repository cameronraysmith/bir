\begin{block}{abstract coherence in multilevel systems}
In this light, we can view a process in which interactions among local entities generate higher-level properties that themselves also become derived entities that may participate in still higher-level processes as requiring the type of coherence among the lower-level entities precisely specified by the sheaf condition.

\begin{block}{evaluating coherence constraints}
As biological systems are comprised of a nested hierarchy, this constraint---as applied to models of biological systems in terms of algebraic structures that connect internal and external consequences of interactions, not limited to but including the graphs which are often produced from network data---can be tested on systems that require integrating information across levels of organization in order to function.
