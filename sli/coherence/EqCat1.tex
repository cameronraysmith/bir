For the case in which $Q$ is also a sheaf on $\mathcal{L}_0$, it can be dually characterized in terms of a colimit of representable functors $PSh(L_0) = Mor_{\mathcal{L}_0}(-,L_0)$. Additionally, the representable functors are sheaves for the case of the subcanonical topology $J$ on $\mathcal{L}_0$ defined above.
