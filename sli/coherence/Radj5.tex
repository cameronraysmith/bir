Since this construction is parametric in $L_0 \in \Ob(\mathcal{L}_0)$ for a corresponding $L_1 \in \Ob(\mathcal{L}_1)$ of the topology $J$ then $R$ is a $J$-sheaf for the site $(\mathcal{L}_0,J)$.

For those cases in which $L_1$ represents an object in $\Ob(\mathcal{L}_0)$ then $R(L_1)$ is equivalent to the functor represented by the object $L_0$ in the presheaf category on $\mathcal{L}_0$.

When all representable functors are sheaves, the topology $J$ is referred to as the subcanonical topology on $\mathcal{L}_0$.
