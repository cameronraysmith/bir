%In order to be able to represent objects and their interactions in the global category of higher-order interacting biological entities in terms of diagrams modeled in the local category of such we make use of a generalized form of topology that can be applied to any category meeting a few constraints and that can be specialized to, for example, the case in which objects and morphisms of the category take on a particular type of algebraic structure. The purpose of this construction is to develop a method of defining a {\it covering system} composed of interacting entities in the category representing local interactions that can be used to establish a decomposition of objects in the category representing global interactions that may each rely on a certain type of composition of local interactions with respect to any biological system. We first give a conceptual overview of the standard concepts of {\it sieve}, {\it Grothendieck topology}, {\it site}, and {\it sheaf} for an arbitrary category $\cC$ and then explain how covering sieves on $\mathcal{L}_0$ defined in terms of epimorphic families of morphisms in $\mathcal{L}_1$ provides a Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which induces a site and sheaves on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which can be shown to precisely encode the category $\mathcal{L}_1$. The theoretical constraints necessary to ensure the equivalence between information represented in terms of sheaves on the category $\mathcal{L}_0$ and information represented in terms of the category $\mathcal{L}_1$ provide a framework for understanding hierarchically organized systems. The process of transforming the category $\mathcal{L}_0$ into its category of sheaves may then provide broad but precise insight into transitions in hierarchical organization, which is a common property providing a unifying perspective on some of the major transitions in biological evolution.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition-sieve}
}{}
For any category $\cC$ and $c \in \Ob(\cC)$ a {\it sieve} $S$ on $c$ is a collection in $\Mor(\cC)$ with codomain $c$ such that for $f,g \in \Mor(\cC)$
$$
f \in S \Rightarrow f \circ g \in S
$$
whenever there is a $g \in \Mor(\cC)$ such that $cod(g)=dom(f)$. Any sieve can be restricted to a sieve on the domain of a map whose codomain is the object of the sieve. If $S$ is a sieve on $c$ and $h:d \rightarrow c \in \Mor(\cC)$ with $cod(h)=c$ then
$$
h^* (S) \equiv \{ g \, | \, cod(g)=d, h \circ g \in S \}
$$
is a sieve on $d$.

A (maximal) sieve is thus a collection of (all) morphisms impinging on a given object upon which it is defined. Examples of sieves on an algebraic lattice are shown in figure \ref{fig:sieve}. There is a simple connection between sieves and the Yoneda embedding $PSh:\cC \rightarrow \textit{Sets}^{\cC^{opp}}$. A sieve on $c$ is a subfunctor $Sc \subseteq hom(-,c)$ of the functor in the presheaf category on $\cC$ that is represented by $c \in \Ob(\cC)$. Placing constraints on such sieves enables the definition of an abstract notion of topology on a category.

\begin{frame}
\iftoggle{thmsty}{
\begin{definition}
\label{definition-grothendieck-topology}

A {\it Grothendieck topology} on a category $\cC$ is a function $J$ that assigns a collection $J(c)$ of sieves on $c$ to each $c \in \Ob(\cC)$ such that conditions of maximality, stability and transitivity are satisfied respectively
\begin{enumerate}
\item the maximal sieve $M_c = \{f \, | \, cod(f) = c\} \in J(c)$,
\item for $S \in J(c)$, $f^*(S) \in J(d)$ for any $f:d \rightarrow c \in \Mor(\cC)$,
\item for $S \in J(c)$, $R \in J(c)$ for any sieve $R$ on $c$ with $f^* (R) \in J(d)$ for all $f:d \rightarrow c \in S$.
\end{enumerate}
Sieves $S$ in $J(c)$ for an object $c \in \Ob(\cC)$ are referred to as $J-covering$ sieves.

A {\it basis} for a topology on a category $\cC$ that has pullbacks is a function $B$ that assigns to each object $c \in \Ob(\cC)$ a collection of families $\{c_i \rightarrow c \}$ of morphisms referred to as {\it covering families} in $B(c)$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item every family consisting of a single isomorphism $\{ d \cong c \}$ is a covering family in $B(c)$
\item if $\{f_i:c_i \rightarrow c \}$ is a covering family and $g:d \rightarrow c$ is any morphism in $\Mor(\cC)$ then $\{g^* c_i \rightarrow d \}$ is a covering family in $B(d)$ of $d$, which means that the collection of covering families is stable under pullbacks
\item if $\{f_i : c_i \rightarrow c \}_{i \in I}$ is a covering family and $\{ g_{i,j} : c_{i,j} \rightarrow c_i \}_{j \in J_i}$ then the family of composites $\{ f_i \circ g_{i,j} : c_{i,j} \rightarrow c_i \rightarrow c \}_{i \in I, j \in J_i}$ is a covering family in $B(c)$

}{}
A pair $(\cC,J)$ or $(\cC,B)$ consisting of a category $\cC$ and a Grothendieck topology $J$ on $\cC$ or a basis $B$ for such a topology is referred to as a {\it site}. If $S \in J(c)$, then $S$ is a {\it covering sieve} of $c$. If $B$ is a basis on $\cC$, then $B$ is said to {\it generate} a topology $J$ according to the equivalence between the statements that a sieve $S$ is a $J$-cover and that a sieve $S$ contains an associated $B$-cover
$$
S \in J(c) \Longleftrightarrow \exists Q \in B(c), \,\,\, Q \subseteq S.

\label{definition-sheaves}
}{}
Given a basis for, $B$, or an explicit Grothendieck topology, $J$, on a category $\cC$ we can define necessary conditions in order for presheaves $P$ in the presheaf category $\textit{Sets}^{\cC^{opp}}$ to be sheaves on the site $(\cC,J)$. If in addition to $P$ we have the sieve $S$ that is a cover of an object $c \in \Ob(\cC)$, then we can define a {\it matching family} for $S$ from elements of $P$ as a function assigning to each $f:d \rightarrow c \in S$ an element $x_f \in P(d)$ such that
$$
\forall g:e \rightarrow d \in \Mor(\cC), \,\,\, x_f \cdot g = x_{fg},
$$
where $x_f \cdot g \equiv P(g)(x_f)$ and $fg \in S$. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
We can further define an {\it almagamation} of a matching family as a single element $x \in P(c)$ such that
$$
\forall f \in S, \,\,\, x \cdot f = x_f,
$$
implying that $P(f)(x)=x_f$ and thus $P(g)(P(f)(x))=x_{fg}$. $P$ is then a {\it sheaf} for $J$ when every matching family for all covers of all objects in $\Ob(\cC)$ have a unique amalgamation. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
A sieve $S$ on an object $c$ is a subfunctor of the functor represented by $c$ under the Yoneda embedding. This is to say that $S \subseteq h^c = hom(-,c)$. In this case, $P$ is a sheaf if and only if for every covering sieve $S$ on $c$ the inclusion $S \hookrightarrow P$ induces an isomorphism $hom(S,P) \cong hom(h^c,P)$. This can also be expressed as the equalizer
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix{
P(c) \ar[r]
&
\prod\limits_{f \in S}
P(dom \, f)
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-{p} \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{a}
&
\prod\limits_{\substack{f,g \,\,\, f \in S \\ dom \, f=cod \, g}}
P(dom \, g)
}
\end{displaymath}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix{
P(c) \ar[r]
&
\prod\limits_{f \in S}
P(dom \, f)
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-{p} \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{a}
&
\prod\limits_{\substack{f,g \,\,\, f \in S \\ dom \, f=cod \, g}}
P(dom \, g)
}
\end{displaymath}
\noindent for each $c \in \Ob(\cC)$ and each cover $S \in J(c)$. $e$ refers to $e(x)=\{x \cdot f\}_f = \{P(f)(x)\}_f$, $p$ refers to $p( \mathbf{x} )_{f,g} = x_{fg}$, and $a$ refers to $a( \mathbf{x} )_{f,g} = x_f \cdot g$ for $\mathbf{x} = \{ x_f \}_{f \in S}$. Given that the equalizer condition, $p \circ e = a \circ e \Leftrightarrow p=a$, is satisfied for a cover $S$ then $P$ is a sheaf with respect to the cover $S$.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Finally, to express the sheaf condition in terms of a basis $B$ for a topology $J$ generated by $B$ on a category $\cC$ having pullbacks. If $Q = \{ f_i : c_i \rightarrow c \}_{i \in I}$ is a B-cover of $c$ a family of elements $x_i \in P(c_i)(i \in I)$ is a matching family for $Q$ if $ x_i \cdot \pi_{ij}^1 = x_j \cdot \pi_{ij}^2$ for all $i,j \in I$. $\pi^1$ and $\pi^2$ are defined as
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix{
c_i \times_c c_j \ar[r]^-{\pi_{ij}^2} \ar[d]_{\pi_{ij}^1} & c_j \ar[d]^{f_j} \\
c_i \ar[r]^{f_i} & c
}
\end{displaymath}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\noindent Now again, a presheaf $P \in \textit{Sets}^{\cC^{opp}}$ is a sheaf for the topology $J$ generated by the basis $B$ if and only if for any cover $\{ f_i : c_i \rightarrow c \}_{i \in I}$ in $B$ any matching family $\{ x_i \}_i$ has a unique amalgamation $x \in P(c)$ such that $x \cdot f_i = x_i$ for all $i \in I$. This condition can also be expressed in terms of a diagram that is an equalizer
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix{
P(c) \ar[r]
&
\prod\limits_{i \in I}
P(c_i)
\ar@<1ex>[r]^-{p_1} \ar@<-1ex>[r]_-{p_2}
&
P(c_i \times_c c_j)
}
\end{displaymath}
\noindent The morphism $e$ refers to $e(x) = \{ x \cdot f_i \}_i$, $p_1$ refers to $p_1(\{ x_i \})_{i,j} = x_i \cdot \pi_{ij}^1$, and $p_2$ refers to $p_2(\{x_i\})_{i,j} = x_j \cdot \pi_{ij}^{2}$.

We are now able to explain how covering sieves on $\mathcal{L}_0$ defined in terms of epimorphic families of morphisms in $\mathcal{L}_1$ provides a Grothendieck topology on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which induces a site and sheaves on $\mathcal{L}_0$, which can be shown to precisely encode the category $\mathcal{L}_1$.
